* At the start of the game, let the user know how many
  letters the secret_word contains and how many guesses s/he starts with.
* The user should start with 6 guesses

* Before each round, you should display to the user how many guesses
  s/he has left and the letters that the user has not yet guessed.

* Ask the user to supply one guess per round. Remember to make
  sure that the user puts in a letter!

* The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess
  about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.
